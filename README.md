# EduTrackerApplication

Our goal is to implement an application, which tracks the attendance of a student from ITMO University. The student enters its group name, the schedule 
for entered group is downloaded and parsed from ITMO website. Then during every period in schedule an application checks the geolocation of the smartphone and
compares it with the ITMO University address. Then the student can see his plots of attendance. We hope, that they will motivate a student to attend all the classes.

The application is a semester project for Android Applications Development course in ITMO University made by Vitalii Karavaev, Aleksandr Tukallo, Mekhrubon, Turaev.

Current progress:
* ChooseGroupActivity is implemented. The schedule is being successfully downloaded from ITMO website and parsed.
